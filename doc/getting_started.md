# Getting started

## Setting up Rust

Make sure to have the latest stable version of `Rust` installed.
We recommend using [rustup][ru] for that.

After you did that, `Rust` should be fully installed.

## Setting up Sōzu

### Install

`sozu` is published on [crates.io][cr].

To install them, you only have to do `cargo install sozu`.

They will be built and available in the `~/.cargo/bin` folder.

### Build from source

Build the sozu executable and command line:

`cd bin && cargo build --release --locked`

> The `--release` parameter informs cargo to compile sozu with optimizations turned on.
> Only use `--release` to make a production version.
>
> The `--locked` flag tells cargo to stick to dependency versions as specified in `Cargo.lock`
> and thus prevent dependency breaks.

### Cargo features

The Cargo features published by the workspace tune behaviour and select the
TLS crypto provider. Crypto-provider selection is documented in detail under
[Choosing a crypto provider](#choosing-a-crypto-provider) below; the four
providers (`crypto-ring`, `crypto-aws-lc-rs`, `crypto-openssl`, `fips`) are
mutually exclusive at runtime via the precedence chain in
`lib/src/crypto.rs::default_provider()`.

| Feature | Crate(s) | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `tolerant-http1-parser` | `lib`, `bin` | Relaxes H1 parsing via `kawa/tolerant-parsing`. |
| `simd` | `lib`, `bin` | Enables `kawa/simd` SIMD acceleration. |
| `splice` | `lib`, `bin` | Linux-only zero-copy TCP forwarding via `splice(2)`. Default 64 KiB kernel-pipe per session per direction; tunable via `splice_pipe_capacity_bytes` (clamped at `/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size`). Applies to `Protocol::TCP` listeners only. |
| `opentelemetry` | `lib`, `bin` | Compiles in OpenTelemetry export. |
| `logs-debug` | all | Compiles in `DEBUG` logs (release strips them otherwise). |
| `logs-trace` | all | Compiles in `TRACE` logs (release strips them otherwise). |
| `e2e-hooks` | `lib` | Test-injection APIs — never enable in production builds. |

The authoritative list per crate lives in the per-crate `Cargo.toml`
(`lib/Cargo.toml`, `bin/Cargo.toml`, `command/Cargo.toml`); `cargo build
--all-features --locked` succeeds across the workspace today.

## HTTP/2 support

Sōzu supports HTTP/2 out of the box, with no additional configuration needed for most
use cases.

**Frontend (client → Sōzu):** HTTP/2 is automatically available on all HTTPS listeners.
Clients negotiate the protocol during the TLS handshake via ALPN. To disable HTTP/2
on a specific listener, set `alpn_protocols = ["http/1.1"]`.

**Backend (Sōzu → server):** By default, Sōzu speaks HTTP/1.1 to backends. To use
cleartext HTTP/2 (h2c) for backend connections, set `http2 = true` on the cluster:

```toml
[clusters.MyCluster]
protocol = "http"
http2 = true
frontends = [
  { address = "0.0.0.0:8443", hostname = "app.example.com", certificate = "cert.pem", key = "key.pem", certificate_chain = "chain.pem" }
]
backends = [
  { address = "127.0.0.1:8080" }
]
```

Make sure `buffer_size` is at least **16393** (16384 max H2 frame + 9 byte header) in
the global configuration section.

You can also toggle HTTP/2 at runtime using the CLI:

```bash
sozu cluster h2 enable --id MyCluster
sozu cluster h2 disable --id MyCluster
```

**Security:** Sōzu includes built-in flood detection for HTTP/2 connections, protecting
against Rapid Reset (CVE-2023-44487), CONTINUATION flood (CVE-2024-27316), and other
protocol abuse vectors. Thresholds are configurable per-listener — see the
[configuration reference](./configure.md#h2-flood-detection-thresholds) for details.

**Priorities:** Sōzu implements RFC 9218 Extensible Priorities. Streams with the
`priority` header (`u=N, i` format) are scheduled by urgency level, ensuring
higher-priority responses are sent first.

See the [configuration reference](./configure.md) for all HTTP/2 options, or the
[H2 Mux Internals](./h2_mux_internals.md) for developer-facing implementation details.

### Choosing a crypto provider

Sōzu uses [Rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) for TLS and supports multiple cryptographic backends, selected at compile time via feature flags. Only one crypto provider can be enabled at a time.

| Feature | Backend | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `crypto-ring` (default) | [ring](https://github.com/briansmith/ring) | No extra system dependencies |
| `crypto-aws-lc-rs` | [AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs) | Post-quantum key exchange support. Requires `cmake` |
| `crypto-openssl` | [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (via rustls-openssl) | Uses the system OpenSSL. Requires `cmake` and OpenSSL dev headers |
| `fips` | AWS-LC in FIPS mode | FIPS 140-3 compliance. Requires `cmake` |

```bash
# Default build (ring)
cd bin && cargo build --release --locked

# AWS-LC with post-quantum support
cd bin && cargo build --release --locked --no-default-features --features crypto-aws-lc-rs

# OpenSSL backend
cd bin && cargo build --release --locked --no-default-features --features crypto-openssl

# FIPS 140-3 compliance (aws-lc-rs in FIPS mode)
cd bin && cargo build --release --locked --no-default-features --features fips
```

> When using `--no-default-features`, the `jemallocator` allocator is also disabled.
> Add it back explicitly if desired: `--features jemallocator,crypto-aws-lc-rs`.
