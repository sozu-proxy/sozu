/// Contains Rust types generated by [`prost`](https://docs.rs/prost/latest/prost/)
/// using the protobuf definition in `command.proto`.
///
/// The two main types are `Request` and `Response`.
///
/// Because these types were originally defined in Rust, and later adapted for protobuf,
/// the Rust translation of the protobuf definition looks a bit weird. Instead of having
/// `Request` being a simple enum with Payload like this:
///
/// ```ignore
/// pub enum Request {
///     SaveState(String),
///     LoadState(String),
///     // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It is defined with `oneof` in protobuf. and looks like this in Rust:
///
/// ```ignore
/// pub struct Request {
///     pub request_type: ::core::option::Option<request::RequestType>,
/// }
///
/// pub mod request {
///     pub enum RequestType {
///         #[prost(string, tag = "1")]
///         SaveState(::prost::alloc::string::String),
///         /// load a state file, given its path
///         #[prost(string, tag = "2")]
///         LoadState(::prost::alloc::string::String),
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// but can be instantiated this way:
///
/// ```ignore
/// let load_state_request: Request = RequestType::LoadState(path).into();
/// ```
///
/// A bit cumbersome, but it is the only way to benefit from protobuf in Rust.
